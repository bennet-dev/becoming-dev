# Becoming a Software Engineer

Becoming a self-taught software engineer is not an easy endeavor. For most people, myself included,  it requires significant time and effort to teach themselves how to build software, and get a job doing it. Based on my experience as a self-taught developer, I'll share my thoughts on the process. 

## The Goals
You have two goals to keep in mind:
1) Learn how to build software, and
2) Get a job.
Unless you simply want to be a hobbyist, these objectives are inherently linked, and we can't forget that. You must work toward both goals in tandem. Keeping both goals in mind can also provide an important framework for deciding which technologies you decide to invest in learning. For example, learning an obscure programming language may be fun and educational, but it may not be the best choice if we also want to get a job. 

Here, I also want to mention the importance of learning Git and using Github, since I consider it an important part of pursuing both goals in tandem. I have met many beginners who put off learning how to use Git and don't put their projects up on Github or don't commit to them regularly. I consider this a big mistake. Not only is Git/Github going to be required knowledge at any programming job, it's also a great way (the best way) to demonstrate that you can build software. Hopefully it comes as no surprise to you that potential employers will be interested to know if you can actually build software. 

As you move forward on your journey, learning how to be a software engineer, you should build many projects. As you build them you should **commit often** and **push** those commits to your Github repo. Your Github profile can show a "contribution graph", which is basically a graph of your commits over time. To employers, having a computer science degree demonstrates at least a baseline understanding of software development. Since we don't have computer science degrees, we have to demonstrate our credibility in other ways. Seeing a nice, full contribution graph can give a healthy boost to your credibility as a software developer. 

## Be Persistent 
This journey will require a heavy dose of persistence. No matter when you began learning how to code, there is an ***unknown*** date in the future when you will be offered your first job. The keyword here is ***"unknown"***. However long you *think* it will take you to get your first job as a software engineer, you're wrong. The fact is, you simply have no idea how long this is going to take or how difficult it will be for you. Job markets fluctuate, technologies change, and you have to adapt. You have to decide how persistent you are willing to be. Perhaps you need to grapple with the idea that this may take you years. You just don't know. This is why I wouldn't recommend you bet the farm on this. Don't quit your day job thinking you'll land a gig in a couple months. The beauty of being self-taught is that it doesn't have to cost you money to learn to code. This can be a low risk, high reward endeavor. All it costs is your time and effort.
Take whatever risks you are willing and comfortable taking. Just keep in mind that you only have control over how prepared you are for the job, not when the job is offered. You can *influence* the timing by your efforts, but you cannot *control* it.

## How To Develop Software 
Here I am not speaking to specific software development methodologies (i.e. functional programming, object oriented programming, etc.), I am more concerned with how to learn how to develop software. Learning how to develop software is simple, but not necessarily easy. I don't believe there is any escaping the fact that you simply have to write a lot of code. Many people will follow a tutorial or finish an online course, but when they sit down to begin a project of their own, they discover that they still have no idea what they are doing. The bottom line is, they have not repeated the process enough. 

A method that I have used is to build the same project over, and over again. If I follow a tutorial on, for example, how to build a blog, for my first iteration I will just follow along. After that, I'll build it again, the second time, trying my best to rely less on the tutorial. If I'm stuck, I'll try to find solutions on the internet. If I need to, I'll first reference my previous code, and lastly I'll refer to the tutorial. Doing this repeatedly may sound dull and boring, but it will impress in your mind the patterns of how to build an app. Eventually, you will not need a tutorial to build the app, and you'll be pleasantly surprised to learn that these same patterns apply to other types of apps as well.

You have to repeat the process of building software enough times that it becomes something you can just do without following a tutorial. It's similar to learning a musical instrument. In the beginning of learning the guitar, chords are hard. Transitioning between chords is clunky and slow. With enough practice, you no longer even need to think about the chords, you just play them. 

**Remember:** Github! Throughout this process, commit to Github. And on any other projects you work on, commit to Github. The benefits of this are too great to ignore. 

## How To Get a Job
Many courses or YouTubers push this idea that you just need a portfolio website, and you get a job. It's my belief that the importance of this is overstated (usually by people pushing a course). I still feel it's important, particularly for someone with zero experience, but I'm afraid that a poor quality portfolio can do more harm than good, and that you'd be better off with no portfolio and a full contribution graph.

When you begin working on your resumé and applying to jobs, remember, you are not applying for favors. The overall tone of your resumé should not be *"I know I don't have any experience, but I promise I'll work hard if you just give me a chance!"*. The opposite will serve you better. Your resumé is an advertising document, and your message should be one of *"This is what I can do for you, and here is the evidence."*. I've seen too many resumés that read like a cry for help, rather than a display of value. Above all, remember, it's not your job to tell the employer why they *shouldn't* hire you.

There are plenty of resources out there for resumé help, so I won't go into it too much. I will only add that you can and should include your projects as experience. 

When applying for jobs, keep in mind that, especially for junior positions, there can be hundreds, or even thousands, of applicants for a single job posting. To put it bluntly, the odds are *not* in your favor. This means firstly, if you have connections or you are able to network, do it. You have to. In any case, you have to go the extra mile. If they ask for a cover letter, write one. If you can, follow up with an email. Anything to tip the scales in your favor. At the end of the day, this is a numbers game. Apply to everything. This process alone requires ***significant time and effort*** sustained over a long period of time. Again, ***Persistence***.

If you wait to begin applying for jobs until you feel ready, or you think you've learned enough, you'll never apply. There is no obvious stage of the process I can point to and say "this is when you start applying". All I can say is, start applying sooner than later. At the very least, if you get any interviews, they will be good practice and give you an idea of what to expect. The *worst* that could happen is they actually offer you a job!

## An Uncomfortable Truth
Look at the advertising for some of the courses and bootcamps out there.

You'll see things like "Zero to Hero!", "Become a software engineer!", "Become a JavaScript Pro!".

Look at the sheer number of courses and bootcamps that are available!

"Learning to code" has become akin to a get rich quick scheme. The implication of some of these courses is "Take my 20 hour Udemy course and become a highly paid engineer". Of course you'll find the super genius on Reddit who went from zero to hero in a week and now works at Google, and they're *totally* not lying. In reality, there are outliers on either end of the spectrum. Those who learn to code and manage to get a job in a few months, and those who take a few years. A lot of factors can play into this, one of the biggest being how much time you can *consistently* dedicate to focused study.
Regardless, the uncomfortable truth is that becoming a self taught software engineer will take ***significant*** time and effort.

Another important fact is that there is a lot of content about learning how to code. Much of it, including the actual documentation for the languages and frameworks you'll learn, is completely free. On the other hand, there is a ton of paid content as well. There is no shortage of people willing to take your money. Paying for a course when there are free ones available is not necessarily a poor choice. Some content is behind a paywall because it's really high quality. Some content is just behind a paywall. The problem is that when you're inexperienced, you don't have the ability to tell the difference between high quality code and terrible code, let alone good courses and bad courses.

Some people say they prefer to pay for courses simply because it gives them more motivation to actually do the course, so they get their money's worth. I won't argue with that, but some of these bootcamps are charging $10,000 to $20,000. Thats a lot to pay for a little discipline. There is a fallacy that exists called the "Price-Quality Heuristic". It states that the higher priced a product is, the more likely we are to assume it is of a higher quality. Why use [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), when I can pay $400 for a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) course? Surely the paid course is better, right? The answer is *maybe*. But also, *maybe not*.

I don't have a solution for parsing out the good from the bad content out there. I'm merely pointing out that you *can*, in fact, learn how to code 100% for free, if you so choose. The free (or nearly free) resources available are, in my experience, of a surprisingly high quality. Especially for people just starting out. If, after you've had a job, you want to learn some niche programming language or a specific software development methodology, by all means, buy a course. There will still likely be free options available, but in my experience when you get into more advanced/niche topics, it may be worth it to pay.

Another challenge, due to the sheer volume of different content, is knowing *what* to study. What language to choose, what framework within that language, front end, back end, full stack. The list goes on. More important than *what* you pick is that you stick with what you picked. Do the research. Ask around. But if you are continually jumping around from one language to another, or learning another framework before mastering the first, you will waste time and energy. You will be better served by picking one thing, and getting good at it. Once you get good at it, your skills will more easily transfer to another language or framework (and you will actually have *skills* to transfer).

## Conclusion 
Becoming a self-taught software engineer is a challenging goal. But it is doable. Be as consistent as you can be. Be persistent for as long as you are able. Have confidence in your ability to learn, and don't fear mistakes. The best learning occurs when you overcome a challenge or finally fix a pesky bug. 

Thanks for reading, and best of luck!
